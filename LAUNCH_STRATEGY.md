# Campus Rentals - Launch Strategy & Commission Guide
**Updated:** January 2025

---

## 🎯 Commission Rate: 12% (Recommended)

### Why 12% is the Perfect Balance

**Competitive Analysis:**
- **Zillow Rental Manager:** $520/year (~3.6% for $1,200/month property) - but YOU do all the work
- **Apartments.com:** ~$29-58 per successful lease (~0.2-0.4% of annual rent)
- **Traditional Property Managers:** 58-112% of first year's rent (7-10% monthly + placement fee)
- **Your Rate:** 12% one-time = **1.4 months of rent** to fill a vacancy

**Your Value Proposition:**
✅ Active marketing on campus WhatsApp groups (1000+ students)
✅ Professional application processing
✅ Tenant screening & scheduling
✅ Commission protection system
✅ Zero risk: Pay only on success

**ROI for Owners:**
- Average vacancy costs: ~8.3% of annual rent per month
- You typically fill vacancies 3-4 weeks faster than DIY
- One month of vacancy saved = $1,200 (more than your commission!)

## 📊 Commission Structure

### Single, Simple Rate: 12%

**No tiered pricing. No confusion. One rate for everyone.**

### How to Pitch to Owners:

#### Option 1 - Success-Based (Best for Cold Outreach):
> "No upfront costs. Pay just 12% when we successfully fill your property. If we don't find you a tenant, you pay $0."

#### Option 2 - Cost Comparison (Best for Objections):
> "Just 1.4 months of rent for full tenant placement service. Traditional agents charge 1-2 months upfront PLUS ongoing monthly fees."

#### Option 3 - ROI Focus (Best for Business-Minded Owners):
> "Fill your vacancy 2-3 weeks faster than DIY posting. Our 12% fee pays for itself by eliminating just 1 month of vacancy."

#### Option 4 - Monthly Equivalent (Best for Small Landlords):
> "Only $180/month marketing investment for a $1,200 property. That's less than 2 Starbucks coffees per day to fill your vacancy."

### Calculation Examples:

| Monthly Rent | Annual Rent | 12% Commission | Equivalent To |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| $600        | $7,200      | $864           | 1.4 months rent |
| $1,000      | $12,000     | $1,440         | 1.4 months rent |
| $1,200      | $14,400     | $1,728         | 1.4 months rent |
| $1,500      | $18,000     | $2,160         | 1.4 months rent |
