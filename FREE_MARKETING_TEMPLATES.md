👋 Fellow USC Parents - Quick Question

For those of you who own properties near campus (or are thinking about it):

How are you handling the rental/management aspect?

My family invested in a property near USC for our student, and we rent out the extra rooms to offset costs. It's working great, but I know the management part can be challenging.

Curious what others are doing:
• Managing yourselves?
• Using a property manager?
• Just renting the whole place out?
• Dealing with it remotely?

Would love to hear your experiences and any tips!

[Comment naturally, then if people respond:]

Update: Several people asked what we're doing. We partnered with OG Properties - they handle everything (tenant screening, rent collection, maintenance) for 12% commission. Game changer for us since we're not in LA. Happy to share more if helpful! www.og-rooms.com

📊 USC Student Housing Market Data - February 2025

For those investing in USC-area properties, here are the current numbers:

RENTAL RATES (per room):
• 1 block from campus: $800-900/month
• 2-3 blocks: $700-800/month
• 4-6 blocks: $650-750/month

OCCUPANCY:
• Well-managed properties: 95-98%
• Self-managed average: 85-90%

TIME TO FILL:
• Professional marketing: 2-3 weeks
• DIY listings: 6-8 weeks

KEY INSIGHTS:
✓ Students will pay 20-30% premium for amenities (washer/dryer, AC, parking)
✓ Room-by-room rental generates 30-40% more than whole-house
✓ Academic calendar creates strong seasonal demand
✓ Parent co-signers reduce risk significantly

BIGGEST CHALLENGES:
• Finding 4-5 qualified tenants per property
• Semester turnover
• Coordinating multiple students/parents
• Maintenance during academic crunch times

Anyone else investing in student housing? What's your strategy?

[In comments, if asked what you do:]

We specialize in USC student housing management - handle the tenant placement, rent collection, maintenance coordination. The semester turnover is definitely the trickiest part, but having systems in place makes it manageable. www.og-rooms.com if you want to see how we structure things.

### Post 3: General LA Landlord Groups
**Best for:** LA Landlords, Property Management Groups

```
🤔 QUESTION: What % management fee do you pay?

Doing some research on property management fees in LA area.

What are you paying your property manager?

• What's your fee structure? (%)
• Any additional charges? (leasing fees, renewal fees, etc.)
• Are you happy with the service?
• What location/property type?

I'm seeing wide ranges (10% to 20%+) and trying to understand what's fair.

Appreciate any insights!

[In discussion, mention:]

We charge 12% flat with zero additional fees (no leasing fee, no renewal fee, nothing hidden). Seems like industry average is 15-20%, so we positioned below that. Specializing in USC student housing helps us keep costs down. www.og-rooms.com

Title: Off-Campus Housing Tips for USC Students (from a property manager)

I manage several properties around USC and wanted to share some tips for students looking for off-campus housing:

RED FLAGS to avoid:
• Landlord won't do background check (sketchy)
• No written lease agreement
• Security deposit in cash only
• Unwilling to show property before signing
• Pressure to sign immediately

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
• Clear lease terms
• Working smoke detectors & locks
• Responsive landlord/management
• Transparent pricing (no hidden fees)
• Proper maintenance protocols

QUESTIONS TO ASK:
• Who handles maintenance emergencies?
• What's included in rent?
• When is rent due?
• How are roommate disputes handled?
• What happens if I need to break the lease?

PRICING REALITY CHECK (Feb 2025):
• Shared room: $600-800/month
• Private room: $800-1000/month
• Includes: Usually utilities, sometimes WiFi
• Parking: Extra $100-150/month

Feel free to ask questions! Happy to help fellow Trojans find safe, fair housing.
