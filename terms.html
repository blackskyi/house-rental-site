                <p>
                    Welcome to Campus Rentals. By accessing or using our platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms").
                    Please read them carefully.
                </p>

                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    By using Campus Rentals (the "Platform"), you agree to these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and all applicable laws and regulations.
                    If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Platform Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Campus Rentals is a property listing platform that connects property owners ("Owners") with prospective tenants ("Tenants").
                    We facilitate the application process but are not party to any rental agreements between Owners and Tenants.
                </p>

                <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
                <h3>3.1 Property Owners</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Must provide accurate information when creating an account</li>
                    <li>Responsible for maintaining the security of their account</li>
                    <li>Must comply with the Property Owner Agreement</li>
                    <li>Agree to pay platform commission (16% of first year's rent) for tenants found through the platform</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.2 Tenants</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Must provide truthful information in rental applications</li>
                    <li>Must not misrepresent financial status, employment, or references</li>
                    <li>Understand that applications are submitted to property owners through the platform</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Platform Commission</h2>
                <p>
                    Property Owners agree to pay Campus Rentals a <strong>one-time success fee of 12% of the first year's gross rent</strong>
                    for any tenant sourced through the Platform. This applies for 12 months from initial application date.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.95rem; background: #e8f4fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 6px;">
                    <strong>No upfront costs.</strong> Pay only when we successfully place a tenant. If we don't find you a tenant, you pay $0.
                    Example: For a property renting at $1,200/month ($14,400/year), the success fee would be $1,728, payable upon lease signing.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
                <p>Users may not:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the Platform for fraudulent or illegal purposes</li>
                    <li>Circumvent the Platform to avoid commission payments</li>
                    <li>Harass, threaten, or discriminate against other users</li>
                    <li>Post false, misleading, or discriminatory listings</li>
                    <li>Scrape, copy, or misuse Platform content without permission</li>
                    <li>Violate fair housing laws or regulations</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Property Listings</h2>
                <h3>6.1 Owner Responsibilities</h3>

                    All initial communications between Owners and Tenants must go through the Platform to maintain tracking
                    and ensure commission compliance. Direct circumvention violates these Terms.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Fair Housing Compliance</h2>
                <p>
                    All users must comply with federal, state, and local fair housing laws. Discrimination based on race, color,
                    religion, sex, national origin, familial status, or disability is prohibited and will result in immediate
                    account termination.
                </p>
