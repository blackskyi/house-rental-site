## COLD EMAIL SEQUENCE

### Email 1: Initial Introduction
**Subject:** Manage your USC-area rental without the hassle?

Hi [Owner Name],

I noticed you own a property at [Address] near USC.

Are you currently renting to USC students? If so, you know the challenges:
- Finding reliable tenants every semester
- Handling late-night maintenance calls
- Chasing down rent payments
- Dealing with turnover every year

We've built a solution specifically for USC-area property owners like you.

**OG Properties** handles everything:
✓ Professional tenant screening (background + credit checks)
✓ Online rent collection (direct deposit to your account)
✓ 24/7 maintenance coordination
✓ Lease agreements and legal compliance
✓ Marketing to 20,000+ USC students

**You earn more, stress less:**
- No upfront costs - only 12% when you get paid
- Average occupancy rate: 98%
- Owner portal shows everything in real-time
- Setup takes 48 hours

Sara, one of our owners, increased her rental income by 30% while spending zero time on management.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to see if this makes sense for your property?

You can schedule directly here: [Calendly Link]

Or just reply with "interested" and I'll send more details.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

### Email 2: Case Study (Day 3 - if no response)
**Subject:** How Sara filled her 5-bedroom in 2 weeks

Hi [Owner Name],

Quick question - how long did it take you to fill your rental last time?

One of our owners, Sara, used to spend 6-8 weeks finding tenants for her 5-bedroom near campus.

**Her old process:**
- Post on Craigslist (daily)
- Field calls and schedule tours (20+ hours)
- Screen applicants manually
- Deal with no-shows
- Eventually settle for whoever applied

**Now with OG Properties:**
- We listed her property professionally
- Screened 40+ qualified USC student applicants
- Filled all 5 rooms in 14 days
- She approved tenants from her phone
- Direct deposit rent started on day 1

Her only "work" was signing off on qualified tenants from our pre-screened list.

**The numbers:**
- Old way: $2,400/month gross, 6-8 weeks vacant = ~$3,600 lost
- With us: $3,200/month gross, 2 weeks vacant = $800 lost
- Net result: +$800/month income, +$2,800 in saved vacancy costs

And she hasn't gotten a single 2am maintenance call in 8 months.

Want to see how this could work for your property at [Address]?

I've opened up my calendar: [Calendly Link]

Or reply with your property details and I'll send you a custom rental income projection.

### Day 7 After Call (Final Follow-Up)
**Subject:** Following up one last time - [Address]

Hi [Owner Name],

I wanted to follow up one last time about managing your property at [Address].

I haven't heard back after our call last week, which usually means one of three things:

1. **You're still thinking about it** - Totally normal! What questions can I answer?

2. **Now's not the right time** - No problem. When would make more sense? Spring? Next school year?

3. **You've decided not to move forward** - That's okay too. Can I ask what made you decide that?

Whatever it is, I'd appreciate hearing from you so I know how to help (or not bother you anymore!).

Just reply with where you're at, and I'll take it from there.

Thanks again for your time, [Owner Name].
