2.1 Success Fee
Owner agrees to pay Platform a ONE-TIME SUCCESS FEE of TWELVE PERCENT (12%)

NO UPFRONT COSTS: Owner pays $0 until a tenant is successfully placed.
If Platform does not find a tenant, Owner owes nothing.

2.2 Commission Calculation Examples:
   - Monthly rent $1,000 × 12 months = $12,000 annual rent
   - Platform success fee: $12,000 × 12% = $1,440

   - Monthly rent $1,200 × 12 months = $14,400 annual rent
   - Platform success fee: $14,400 × 12% = $1,728 (approximately 1.4 months of rent)

2.3 When Commission is Due
Commission is due when ANY of the following occurs:

   a) Owner enters into a lease agreement with an applicant referred by Platform
   b) Owner rents to ANY member of applicant's stated party/household
   c) Owner rents to the applicant through any arrangement (formal or informal)
   d) Owner accepts payment or deposits from Platform-referred applicant

2.4 Commission Lookback Period
Commission applies to any rental within TWELVE (12) MONTHS from the date of
